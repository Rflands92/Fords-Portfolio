## 👋 About This Portfolio

This repository contains GIS projects completed as part of my ArcGIS Enterprise and Server coursework. Projects focus on spatial analysis, Python scripting with the ArcGIS API, and real-world environmental data. I chose to create this project with a Colorado Wildfire in mind versus the course works suggestion.

## 🔥 Project: East Troublesome Fire (2020) — National Forest Burn Analysis

### Overview
The East Troublesome Fire ignited on October 14, 2020 in Grand County, Colorado and became the **second-largest wildfire in Colorado recorded history**, burning over 193,000 acres. This project uses Python and ArcGIS Pro to answer:

- What was the total acreage burned?
- How much of that area fell within **National Forest boundaries**?
- How did burn severity break down across affected forest land?

### Tools & Technologies
- **ArcGIS Pro** — Project workspace, geoprocessing, spatial analysis
- **arcpy** — Spatial intersection, geometry calculations, feature class management
- **ArcGIS API for Python** — ArcGIS Online authentication, hosted feature layer publishing, Web Map creation
- **Pandas** — Tabular data analysis and summary statistics
- **Matplotlib** — Data visualization and charting
- **Git / GitHub** — Version control and portfolio publishing

### Data Sources
| Dataset | Source |
|---|---|
| Fire Perimeter & Burn Severity (dNBR) | [MTBS — Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity](https://www.mtbs.gov/direct-download) |
| National Forest Boundaries | [USFS Enterprise Data Warehouse](https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php) |
| Basemap Imagery | Esri Living Atlas (ArcGIS Online) |
| Historic Fire Perimeters | [NIFC Open Data Portal](https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com) |

### Methodology
1. Loaded MTBS fire perimeter shapefile and USFS National Forest boundaries
2. Reprojected all data to **NAD 1983 UTM Zone 13N** (EPSG:26913) for accurate area calculations in Colorado
3. Performed spatial **intersection** of fire perimeter × National Forest boundary
4. Calculated **acreage** within and outside National Forest land
5. Overlaid MTBS **dNBR burn severity raster** and tabulated area by severity class
6. Visualized results with charts and an **interactive ArcGIS Online Web Map**
7. Published hosted feature layers to ArcGIS Online portal
